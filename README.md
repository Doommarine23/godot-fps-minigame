# godot-fps-minigame
This is the depot for a Godot 4.x powered mini FPS game

# USAGE
This is a basic but strong foundation to make a FPS game in Godot. Meant to be easy for a single developer.

Based on Kenney's Starter Kit as a foundation with extensive tweaking for more complex features and better scaling.

Just download and go. Sorry no documentation right now.

Custom art assets not included at this time.

(Insert really great instructions and stuff someday)
